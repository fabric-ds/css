# Fabric CSS

This is the core package for Fabric CSS, FINNs design system.

The package includes resets, core components and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility classes tuned
for FINN.

## Usage (preferred)

The CSS should be used directly from Eik. This is because we can alias releases by major versions.

```html
<link href="https://assets.finn.no/pkg/@fabric-ds/css/v0/fabric.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

## Usage (npm)

```sh
npm install @fabric-ds/css
```
